# Cannoli - Toy Ray Tracer roughly based on "Ray Tracing in One Weekend"

### "Leave the gun, take the cannoli" - Goodfellas, starring Ray Liotta. Ray...get it?

This is (rather, is going to be) my implementation of
the [RTiOWE](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#overview) ray tracer. 

It follows RTiOWE in
spirit, but the architecture is going to be substantially different, in order to implement more advanced features down
the line. 

Heavy inspiration is drawn from [Manta Ray](https://github.com/ange-yaghi/manta-ray) by Anghe Yaghi.
